                    <p class="text-faded">
                    When it comes to fast food outlets then Chunky Chicken is top of the pecking order. We are a leader in our field having pioneered the Peri-Peri burger and wrap.

Our story begins in 2005 when a chemical engineer and a food technologist founded Chunky Chicken and opened their first store in Rochdale, United Kingdom. The two old time friends ventured into the fast food business after having already owned a franchise in the automotive business and felt, after a few years, that it was time for a change and the rest is history. To cope with the overwhelming demand for franchising, they decided to re-structure the company in 2011 resulting in Chunky Chicken Worldwide Limited adding corporate and catering expertise to the new management team.

The Chunky Chicken Halal menu has grown over the years beyond just chicken. It now includes chicken wraps, burgers, chicken sandwiches, fresh salads, vegetarian meals, ice cream, coffee and desserts. A key ingredient to Chunky Chicken's success is unchanged - its fantastic signature sauces. The Chunky Chicken motto is, "we eat what we serve and serve what we eat", an “ethos” we would expect all franchisees to adhere to.

Chunky Chicken is focused on the future and we are seeking franchise partners domestically and internationally to join us in our passion for developing the Chunky Chicken brand to a world leading franchise business who’s prime focus is to make the franchisees make money since we are convinced that their success will also be ours.

The business facts speak for themselves. With the opening of our first Chunky Chicken we set a high standard of quality and have maintained it successfully in every one of our outlets to date. We have proven that a Chunky Chicken franchise can be successful anywhere owing to its business model which relies on tightly controlled internal cost structures, an evolving menu offering and dedicated hands on business management.

We have a variety of franchise opportunities in several locations. We would like to hear from you if you want to join us and be part of our expansion in the UK and internationally. Please visit “Development” for more information.

Chunky Chicken serves high quality, freshly cooked made to order food, available for takeout, delivery and dine-in. Today, this simple idea has become one of the hottest franchise opportunities around!

                        Chunky Chicken is a fast growing fast food service concept that offers delivery, take out and dine-in. We tailor the size of the store to the market it will cater for. We have uncompromising service standards that require on going training, a financial reporting system that each franchisee has to adhere to and we provide all equipment and interior design specifications that each store has to conform to. We also require you to purchase food and minor operating equipment and material through our nominated suppliers. This is important to safeguard quality and to conform to our operating standards.

We are good listeners and we encourage a dialogue from day one when you join us. We have a flexible approach, safe from our standards, and you can expect a fast response, as we have a reasonably flat company hierarchy – we don’t believe in complex organisations but in a lean and responsive business with a common agenda – to make the franchisee make money and that it should be easy for people to do business with us.

Everyone working with Chunky Chicken is an important player in the team. We believe in building professional relationships with our franchisees. We are a customer-focused organization, which you will find permeates throughout what we do. We believe in being helpful and polite at all times.

As a Franchisee you buy the right to develop and operate your business in a defined geographical area with a guarantee from us of no Chunky Chicken competitor in that area.

Our best success is the customer loyalty we have built throughout the years. We owe this primarily to our fantastic food. We prepare and cook our food from scratch in our stores everyday, everywhere. Coupled with a genuine friendly approach to our customers, is the recipe for success we would happily share with you to make your business successful as well.

                        Chunky Chicken has a healthy pipeline of development enquiries for which some are in an advance stage of negotiations and others are under consideration.

We have opened our first international Restaurant in May in Calicut, India. Our next international opening will be in June 2015 in Toronto, Canada. Both territories are part of our international development plan under Master Franchise Agreements.

We are prudent in our development pace and have currently a pipeline of 105 stores opening in the next 5 years.

Please refer to the map for locations and status of development.
